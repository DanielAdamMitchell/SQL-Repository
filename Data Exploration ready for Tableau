--First i simply want a general numeric overveiw.
1.
Select SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, sum(cast(new_deaths as int))/sum(new_cases)*100 Death_Percentage
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where continent is not null
order by 1,2

--Second i want to visualise each continents deaths seperately.
2.
Select location, sum(cast(new_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Where continent is null
and location not in ('World', 'European Union', 'International', 'Upper middle income', 'High income', 'Lower middle income', 'Low income')
Group by location 
Order by TotalDeathCount desc

--Thirdly i need data applicable to be setup on a 2d map to show total cases in each country.
3.
Select location, population, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount, MAX(total_cases/population)*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Group by location, population
Order by PercentPopulationInfected desc

--Lastly i wanted to show countries cases over time which i can then predict the future trends in Tableu.
4.
Select location, population, date, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount, MAX(total_cases/population)*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
Group by Location, Population, Date
Order by PercentPopulationInfected desc
